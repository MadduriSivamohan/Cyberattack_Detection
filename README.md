Application of Machine Learning and XAI in Cybersecurity
Overview
This project leverages machine learning (ML) techniques and eXplainable AI (XAI) to enhance cybersecurity, focusing on detecting LDAP attacks using the CICIDS 2019 dataset. The significance of ML in identifying patterns and anomalies in network traffic, alongside the interpretability provided by XAI methods like SHAP, forms the core of this research.

Objectives
Detect LDAP Attacks: Utilize the CICIDS 2019 dataset to develop ML models for identifying LDAP-based cyber threats.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
XAI Integration: Apply SHAP to interpret model decisions and improve transparency in threat detection.
Key Techniques
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): To analyze and reduce data dimensionality.
Andrew Curves: For visualizing and identifying patterns in multivariate data.
Logistic Regression: Selected based on Random Forest feature importance for model training.
SHAP Analysis: For explaining model predictions and enhancing interpretability.
Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 99.97%, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting LDAP attacks. SHAP visualizations provided deep insights into model decisions, reinforcing the model's reliability and interpretability.
